            <p>Hi! I'm Amirul Hakimi bin Rosazlan, a 21-year-old who currently lives in the vibrant city of Ipoh, Perak. I was born and raised here, and over the years, I’ve grown to really appreciate the charm and comfort of my hometown. It’s a place that has shaped me into the person I am today — someone who values simplicity, family, and meaningful connections.</p>
            <p>At the moment, I am a student at Universiti Putra Malaysia. Being part of UPM has been an exciting and eye-opening experience for me. I'm not only learning academically but also meeting new people, exploring different perspectives, and taking on challenges that push me to grow. University life is not always easy, but it’s definitely rewarding in its own way.</p>
            <p>Outside of classes and assignments, I have a couple of hobbies that I’m very passionate about. I love playing video games — it’s my favorite way to unwind and have fun, especially after a long day. Video games have always been a source of excitement and even a way to bond with friends. Besides gaming, I also enjoy watching anime. Whether it's action-packed, emotional, or just plain fun, anime always manages to keep me entertained and inspired.</p>
            <p>Overall, I would describe myself as someone who is always curious, eager to learn, and trying to enjoy life as much as possible. I believe that balancing studies with the things you love is the key to staying motivated and happy. Thank you for taking a moment to get to know me a little better!</p>
